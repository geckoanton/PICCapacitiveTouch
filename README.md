# Capacitive Touch

Some old capacitive touch projects made using PIC microcontrollers. For an explenation of how to use the code and wire up the circuit with a PIC16F886 check out <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Capacitive-Touch-With-PIC16F886-Microcontroller/">my instructables page about capacitive touch</a>. And <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Capacitive-Touch-With-PIC16F886-Microcontroller/">this instructable</a> is for the PIC12F675.
